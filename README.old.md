# **The Challenge** ðŸ’ª

Home rents to a selected group of tenants. The aim of this challenge is to build an application form for tenants, so that they can register with Home and start booking apartments.

We're looking for a multi-page application form, which should include:

-   fields, including:
    -   full name
    -   email
    -   phone number
    -   salary indication (radio buttons)
        -   0 - 1.000
        -   1.000 - 2.000
        -   2.000 - 3.000
        -   3.000 - 4.000
        -   Mehr als 4.000
-   a progress indicator
-   a summary of all the data entered during the flow, displayed on the last page.

Stretch goals to show off ðŸ˜Ž:

-   Animations
-   Responsive design
-   Nice look & feel
-   Automated tests
-   We prefer Typescript over Javascript.

# **When you're done** âœ…

-   a link to your repo on GitHub
-   a short summary of technical choices, the decisions you made and what could be improved.
-   Finally, please include a short Readme to help us launch and test the project.
